  animation, rendering, post-production, interactive creation and
  playback (games).

  written for the ScreenKast program, provides the necessary logic to
  capture screen recordings and to process them. Includes a soap-client
  for the webservice at captorials.com that enables you to share your
  recordings.

\subsection lightspeed Light Speed!

  Light Speed! (http://lightspeed.sourceforge.net/) is an OpenGL-based
  program which illustrates the effects of special relativity on the
  appearance of moving objects. When an object accelerates past a few
  million meters per second, these effects begin to grow noticeable,
  becoming more and more pronounced as the speed of light is approached.
  These relativistic effects are viewpoint-dependent, and include shifts
  in length, object hue, brightness and shape.

\subsection projectm projectM

  projectM (http://projectm.sourceforge.net/) is a music visualizer
  which uses OpenGL for hardware acceleration. It is compatible with
  Milkdrop presets.

\subsection ruby-ftgl Ruby %FTGL

  Ruby %FTGL# (http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-ftgl/) is a collection
  of Ruby bindings for %FTGL.

\subsection tulip Tulip

  Tulip (http://tulip.labri.fr/) is a system dedicated to the
  visualization of huge graphs. It is capable of managing graphs with up
  to 500,000 nodes and edges on relatively modest hardware (eg. 600MHz
  Pentium III, 256MB RAM).

\subsection vtk VTK

  VTK, the Visualization Toolkit (http://www.vtk.org/), is an object
  oriented, high level library that allows one to easily write C++
  programs, Tcl, Python and Java scripts that do 3D visualization.
