FTGL 1.01
October 26 2001

TODO:
	- namespace ftgl or gltt?
	- Distribution MACOS X
	- Get rid of the static activeTextureID in FTTextureGlyph. Maybe
	  replace with glGetIntegerv( GL_TEXTURE_2D_BINDING, activeTextureID);
	
FUTURE:
	- select face ie italic, bold etc
	- Multiple sizes
	- Optimise performance and mem usage.
	- GL evaluators. Are they of any use?
	- gl/glu errors
	- check and confirm the glPixelStore stuff. Data Alignment. Tightly
	  packed at the moment.
	- Use the Freetype Cache mechanism. FTC_xxx
	- Vertical formats
	- For platforms that have antialiased lines but not polys we could
	  outline the polyfonts with lines to get better looking glyphs.
	- Improve the grid fitting scheme in texture fonts.
	- Multiple Masters
	- String Cache or string chunks
	- Provide an interface to access the point data for outlines and
	  polygon meshes.


BUGS:
	- Memory Leak in PolyGlyph (glCombine). This may disappear when access
	  to the point data is sorted. NOTE this is not a fatal leak.
	- Advance/Kerning is screwed up for really small point sizes eg 2 point.
	  This is because I'm trying to use FT_Vector which is integer based.
	  I will probably have to make my own struct with floats.
	- The texture co-ords in the Texture Font may be wrong for non
	  scalable fonts.
	- There is an inconsistancy in the way the global bounding box is
	  stored in Freetype. It is supposed to be in font units but in some
	  cases it is in 16.16 format. I have implemented a work around but
	  hopefully the freetype guys will sort this.
