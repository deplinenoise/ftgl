FTGL 1.3b5
January 27 2002

TODO:
	- namespace ftgl or gltt?
	- use float for all font metrics and advance metrics.
	
	
FUTURE:
	- select face ie italic, bold etc
	- Multiple sizes
	- Optimise performance and mem usage.
	- gl/glu errors
	- check and confirm the glPixelStore stuff. Data Alignment. Tightly
	  packed at the moment.
	- Use the Freetype Cache mechanism. FTC_xxx
	- Vertical formats
	- Multiple Masters
	- String Cache or string chunks
	- Provide an interface to access the point data for outlines and
	  polygon meshes. Part way there with new vectoriser.
	- Have a look at improving the algorthm for making curves. Maybe a
	  distance metric might be the way to go so that rather than having
	  5 polylines (0.2 step) for every curve, adjust the fineness for
	  the length of the curve. But then you should also test the angle
	  of the tangents as well.
	- Guard classes - vectoriser
	- Template methods
    - Move the init code out of the glyph constructors into an init
      function so that they can return errors.
      

BUGS:
	- FTExtrdGlyph - Some glyph contours are 'wound' in reverse causing
	  the 'sides' of the extrusions to be culled. First fix only half
	  worked. When calculating the winding using the summed area I need
	  to use the outside contour only. How do I know it's an outside
	  contour? A workaround is to disable face culling.
	- Advance/Kerning is screwed up for really small point sizes eg 2 point.
	  This is because I'm trying to use FT_Vector which is integer based.
	  I will probably have to make my own struct with floats.
	- The texture co-ords in the Texture Font may be wrong for non
	  scalable fonts.
	- There is an inconsistancy in the way the global bounding box is
	  stored in Freetype. It is supposed to be in font units but in some
	  cases it is in 16.16 format. I have implemented a work around but
	  hopefully the freetype guys will sort this.
	- FTVectoriser seems to position some points incorrectly. confusing
	  line point with control point at start or end????
