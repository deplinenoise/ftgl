September 29 2001
	1.0b7 (FTGL_1_0_BETA_7)
	- Tesselation winding rules
	- Fixed bug in FTContour Add point function
	- Cleaned up disposal of FTCharmap in FTFace
	- renamed FTVectorGlyph to FTOutlineGlyph
	- New distribution structure
	- Minor changes for windows (VC 6)
	- Windows and Linux ports.


September 20 2001
	1.0b6 (FTGL_1_0_BETA_6)
	- Implemented the new FTCharmap class. The performance improvement
	  is dramatic.
	- Tidied up the way the freetype FT_Face object is disposed of by
	  FTFont and FTFace. This was a potential crash.
	- FTVectorGlyph and FTPolyGlyph now disposes of the freetype glyph
	  correctly after initialsation. This was a potential crash.
	- Preliminary support for unicode...wchar_t Tested with non european
	  fonts.
	- Added function to calc the advance width of a string.
	- Minor tidy ups.

	1.0b5 (FTGL_1_0_BETA_5)
	- Settled on integers for FTSize stuff. NOTE the FTGlyph stuff is still
	  up in the air.
	- Fixed the positional stuff.
	- Added Java Doc comments. NOT COMPLETE
	- Fixes for linux, mainly to clear warnings.
	- changed the return type for FTFace::Glyph() from a reference to a
	  pointer so it can return NULL on failure.
	- Related to above...better error handling and reporting in
	  FTGLXXXFont::MakeGlyphList()
	- Fixed a bug in FTVectoriser that was ignoring non printing characters.
	  This meant that the pen wasn't advanced for spaces etc. It affected
	  polygon and outline font rendering.
	- Minor tidy ups.

	1.0b4
	- Changed the mode for FT_Load_Glyph to FT_LOAD_NO_HINTING | FT_LOAD_NO_BITMAP
	  for outline and polygon fonts & FT_LOAD_NO_HINTING for texture fonts.
	  Seems to produce better looking glyphs.
	- FTGLTextureFont can now use multiple textures to render glyphs if
	  they don't fit within one GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE texture. 
	- Changed FTSize to use bbox for global width and height. Needs more
	  work (eg float or int?) and need to check inconsistancies in freetype.
	- Being more strict with types eg integer indices and sizes are now unsigned.

	1.0b3 (FTGL_1_0_BETA_3)
	- I've made fundamental change to the way the glyphlist is built. This
	  is to get round the problems I was having with charmaps. At this stage
	  it is a temporary solution. Previously the glyphList was indexed by
	  char code. Now it's indexed by glyph index and the conversion is done
	  by the freetype function FT_Get_Char_Index(). If this proves to be too
	  slow I'll make my own charmap and use it to index into the glyphlist.
	  This has fixed all the charmap related problems/bugs.
	- Enabled alpha blend in Pixmap font.
	- Enabled LINE_SMOOTH in Outline font
	- Fixed bug that prevented the display of chars >127
	- Moved pixel store stuff out of BitmapGlyph into BitmapFont.
	- Minor changes for IRIX (compiles but isn't tested)
	- Pixmap fonts can now be in colour. It uses the current colour when the
	  font is CREATED. This isn't ideal but is better then the alternatives.
	- Tidied up the error handling.
	- Minor code clean ups.

August 6 2001
	BETA release 1.0b2 (FTGL_1_0_BETA_2)
	- Minor tidy ups for first public release.
	
August 3 2001
	First BETA release 1.0b1 (FTGL_1_0_BETA_1)
	- All font types are now working, Bitmaps, Pixmaps, Texture, Outline
	  and Polygons. Quality of output and performance varies wildly:)

July 22 2001
	First ALPHA Release 1.0a1
