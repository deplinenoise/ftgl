BUGS
====

* FTGLTextureFonts can't be used inside display lists. This because
  the glGet call to check the current texture id can't be used in a
  display list. It is only a valid call when the list is compiled and
  is ignore after that.

* The texture co-ords in the Texture Font may be wrong for non
  scalable fonts.
