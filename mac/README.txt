FTGL Version 1.0

This project will build a static library (archive) in this directory.

FTGL requires the Freetype2 library (version 2.0.3 or later) and OpenGL (glu version 1.2 or later). You may need to edit the paths to point to the correct place. It also uses STL containers.

To use FTGL in your own projects you will need to link against this lib and include the FTGL headers located in the src directory. Your project will also need to point to Freetype and OpenGL.

For instructions on using Freetype go to www.freetype.org
For instructions on using OpenGL go to www.opengl.org

Please contact me if you have any suggestions, feature requests, or problems.
